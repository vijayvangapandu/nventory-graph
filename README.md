# Inventory management system

This is graph based system, the purpose of this system is to track the inventory like.

1. Physical or virtual node/server details
2. Nodes/Servers to service/application associations
3. Node/Server to Hardware and installed operating system associations 
4. Team to Application/Service associations.

Since this is graph based application, all the components are well connected and it is easy to retrieve or traverse from any node.


## Domain Model:
 Nodes
 
 Department     : Departments in company ex: technology
 Team           : Team within department
 Application    : Application, could be a logical name to group of servers serving same purpose, ex: User Service 
 Server         : A Phisical/Victrual node, which hosts the one/many nodes of an application
 Hardware       : Hardware profile ( combination of Memory, CPU and Disk)
 OperatingSystem: Installed operating system 
 
 Relations
 
 ALLOCATED_HARDWARE  : Association between Server and Hardware
 INSTALLED_OS        : Installed OS relation between Server and OperatingSystem
 TEAM_OF             : Department to Team association
 OWNES               : Team to application association
 NODE_OF             : Application to Server association
 
## Application installation
This application is springboot application with embedded jetty container, this can be deployed in jetty container. 
```
1. Install neo4j (https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/)
2. Change neo4j server password 
   Ex: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"password":"blahblah"}' -u neo4j:neo4j http://localhost:7474/user/neo4j/password
3. Update neo4j configuration to enable http and bolt ports
   Add below 3 lines at the bottom of the file {NEO4J_HOME}/conf/neo4j.conf
   dbms.connector.http.address=0.0.0.0:7474
   dbms.connector.https.address=0.0.0.0:7473
   dbms.connector.bolt.address=0.0.0.0:7687
3. Update the connection information under "application.properties" to connect to neo4j instance
   spring.data.neo4j.uri=bolt://host:7687
   spring.data.neo4j.username=neo4j
   spring.data.neo4j.password=blahblah

4. Java8
5. Maven3
